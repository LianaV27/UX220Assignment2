### Learning to Draw
1) What was it you did?
- I learned how to draw pretty well. 
- I'm especially good at sketching with pencil on paper and painting digitally with programs like Photoshop. 
- I primarily draw people/figures. 
- My art style merges realistic shading and bold outlines.

2) When did you do it?
- I've been drawing ever since I was a child and could hold a writing utensil. 
- I often drew for fun and made pictures for my parents. 
- In elementary school, I joined Visual Arts Brampton (VAB), a local arts organization for art classes. 
- I remained a VAB member for roughly seven years. 
- I took two art courses in high school and a drawing and design course in college. 
- I continue to draw to this today for my own enjoyment.

3) What was good about it?
- I became familiar with many different artistic techniques and styles. 
- I met and received instructions from teachers who were artists themselves.
- These lessons greatly improved my skills, encouraged my interest, and gave me an incentive to practice. 
- I am now skilled enough to accurately draw the things I can imagine in detail.

4) What was your favourite memory of it?
- Completing the portfolio assignment for one of my high school art classes.
- We were given prompts (ex. Draw an animal, the view from a window, things in your pocket, etc.) 
- I had fun getting creative with the prompts.
- Among other things, I drew a lynx, the view from a space shuttle, and tangled earbuds. 
- I still consider that portfolio full of realistic drawings to be some of my best work.


5) What didn't you enjoy about it?
- Drawing can be quite frustrating. 
- Sometimes you aren't sure how to fix your drawing.
- Other times, you don't have the skill or knowledge to create the image you want to make. 
- You also need to  get comfortable giving and receiving criticism in art classes.


6) Give your experience a letter grade:
- Grade: A (Couldn't be better.) 
- I honed my skill to a level I am satisfied with and can use it both for work and for fun.
