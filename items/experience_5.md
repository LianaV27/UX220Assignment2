### Volunteering at a Summer Arts Camp
1) What was it you did?
- I volunteered as an assistant for a kids art summer camp program at Beaux Arts Brampton.
- I helped kids with projects, distributed materials, and supervised them during lessons and break time.

2) When did you do it?
- I volunteered in the summer after grade eleven.
- The arts camp ran for a week. 

3) What was good about it?
- I got to help children nurture their interest in the arts. 
- I witnessed the antics only young elementary  school-aged children could get up to. 
- I also enjoyed taking them out for walks to the playground by city hall during break time.

4) What was your favourite memory of it?
- Chatting with the kids while I supervised them at the playground on a sunny day.
- They would come up with amusing games or random topics to talk about. 
- It was nostalgic to see them enjoying the summertime and playing at a park that I once played at.

5) What didn't you enjoy about it?
- Children can be difficult to manage at times. 
- One kid bluntly, though probably unintentionally, made a rude comment about my appearance.
- I remember being stunned. I think I told her that it wasn't a polite thing to say.

6) Give your experience a letter grade:
- Grade: C (It was okay.) 
- While I made the most of it, I don't think I would do it again without outside incentive.
- I was capable enough to do my job, but I don't think I am particularly good with children.
