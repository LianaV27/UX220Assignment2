### French
1) What was it you did?
- I studied the French language for a time in school. 
- I learned how to write, read, and speak in French to some extent.

2) When did you do it?
- I started learning French in the fourth grade, where it was a school subject. 
- I joined the extended French program in my elementary school.
- Extended French: Half the subjects are taught in French from fifth to eighth grade. 
- In high school, I took a French course each year.
- I graduated high school with a French language certificate.

3) What was good about it?
- I thought it was really fun and interesting to learn a new language. 
- I enjoyed learning new terms and eventually being able to read short novels and watch plays in French.
- I had fun practicing it with my brother and father, who both also studied French at some point.

4) What was your favourite memory of it?
- In high school, we were learning about performances in French, including the opera <em>Carmen.</em>
- For a project, we were asked to perform a song from the show in French. 
- A unique challenge that I look back on and laugh about. 
- I sang the aria,"L'amour est un oiseau rebelle" ("Habanera") decently well (according to my mark, at least).

5) What didn't you enjoy about it?
- Learning a new language from scratch is quite difficult.
- Stopping to look up words in a paper dictionary can get irritating.
- Memorizing the conjugations of common verbs was tricky. 
- Presentations were difficult as I didn't always know if I was using or pronouncing words correctly. 

6) Give your experience a letter grade:
- Grade: C (It was okay.) 
- I enjoyed it at the time and put a lot of work into it because I studied it as a school subject. I'd say I'm knowledgeable enough to use French casually or if I didn't have another option, but I don't speak, read, or write in it in my free time otherwise. I do think I could pick it back up easily, but at the moment I am not interested.
