### Trying out Piano
1) What was it you did?
- I took piano lessons.
- I wanted to learn how to play an instrument.

2) When did you do it?
- I joined the Royal Ontario Conservatory of Music.
- I took beginner piano lessons when I was in elementary school. 
- I stayed in the weekly classes for about two years before I quit due to lack of interest.

3) What was good about it?
- Being able to play a song from start to finish was fun, satisfying, and impressive.
- I got to engage with music in a new way (I had only ever listened to it before this- I cannot play anything else).
- Trying my hand at an instrument also gave me a greater appreciation for the skill of musicians.

4) What was your favourite memory of it?
- When I passed the Royal Conservatory's test for my skill level.
- I remember being very nervous beforehand. 
- Passing that test showed that I had improved greatly over the course of my lessons.

5) What didn't you enjoy about it?
- Although I am drawn to music, I didn't feel naturally inclined to practice it. 
- Doing my musical homework often felt tedious, like doing regular school work to me. 
- This caused me to avoid practicing songs and scales.
- I also found memorizing notes and reading music to be complicated and difficult. 
- I didn't enjoy practicing piano in my free time, which led me to quitting.

6) Give your experience a letter grade:
- D (Didn't like it.) 
- My keyboard is now gathering dust.
- Now that I'm older, I'm interested in giving playing an instrument another chance.
- I don't feel piano is the right instrument for me.
