### Competing in a Game Design Jam
1) What was it you did?
- I competed in a week-long college game design jam.
- I was with a randomly assigned team of people I had never met before.

2) When did you do it?
- I did this in my first year in Game Design at Sheridan College. 
- The game Jam was mandatory and program-wide.
- All students of all years were mixed and sorted into teams to compete.

3) What was good about it?
- The team I was assigned to was friendly, worked well together, and possessed the skills we needed.
- We were shortlisted as one of the best teams, making the top ten. 
- The top ten teams were the winners of the competition as there was no rankings within the shortlist. 
- A judge asked our team if we would be interested in showcasing at an event held by the Hand Eye Society. 
- The Hand Eye Society: A non profit game organization.


4) What was your favourite memory of it?
- Attending the game showcase and dance event, the Hand Eye Society Ball, held in Toronto a year later.
- I showcased the game to guests and got to watch so many people enjoy it. 
- I got to dance, play other games, and explore the interactive decorations around the venue with my friend.

5) What didn't you enjoy about it?
- One teammate didn't seem very interested in the project and didn't show up at the beginning of the week.
- Development moves absurdly fast in a week-long game jam so attending is important. 
- She wasn't interested in developing the next iteration of our prototype nor the Hand Eye Society Ball. 

6) Give your experience a letter grade:
- Grade: A (Couldn't be better.) 
- I could not have imagined a better experience for the beginning of my time in Game Design. 
- I cherish those memories and am very proud of the game we made.
